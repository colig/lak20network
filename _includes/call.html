                <p>Interest in social network analysis (SNA) as a way to gain insights into learning has existed in learning analytics (LA) since its inception. As a result, analytical approaches that harness the power of networks are playing important roles in the field. As models, networks allow us to visually communicate learning patterns. As a set of computational techniques, network analysis affords methods to generate network metrics for capturing learning. Despite the uptake of network analysis methods, we observe an underwhelming representation of their applications that (a) accommodate heterogeneous data of learning, (b) model network dynamics and network formation mechanisms within learning settings, or (c) derive new network metrices composite of heterogeneous information underlying network dynamics. The workshop aims to gather LA scholars working in these areas to collectively build a foundation of advanced network modeling of learning data and shape strategies of future work in this important sub-field of LA.</p>

                <h3>Why this Workshop?</h3>
                <p>Since its inception, the Learning Analytics community has integrated the use of network analysis (including Social Network Analysis) and related methodologies into the analysis of learning. Representationally, networks allow us to visually communicate learning patterns; computationally, network analysis presents a suite of methods that generate network metrics potentially useful for assessing learning.</p>
                <p>One would expect that network applications in Learning Analytics would have matured over the last decade.  However, we observe an underwhelming number of their applications that (a) accommodate diverse data sources in learning settings, (b) model network dynamics and network formation mechanisms within learning settings, (c) derive new network metrics that integrate heterogeneous information important for network dynamics, or (d) addresses how to integrate network analytical approaches with other methods, such as text analysis.</p>
                <p>To push the frontier of network analysis in Learning Analytics, we welcome various types of submissions to the workshop including (but are not limited to):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Empirical studies applying advanced network analytical techniques, including understanding properties of networks in learning settings as well as deriving insights about learning built on network analysis</li>
                    <li>Conceptual papers bridging learning processes and network representations</li>
                    <li>Methodological papers introducing approaches that build of off network analysis, or integrate it with other methods</li>
                    <li>Demos featuring tools to support sensemaking of network data or enabling network analysis</li>
                    <li>Classroom applications of network analysis for reflection and regulation of learning processes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The workshop will gather scholars from various disciplinary backgrounds working in these areas to build a foundation of advanced network modeling of learning data. By doing so, we hope to collectively shape strategies of future work in this important sub-field of LA.</p>
                <h3>Workshop Objectives</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>To explore the application of advanced theory-informed network analysis and modeling to learning data through sharing of research-in-progress or tool demos;</li>
                    <li>To explore means of connecting multiple analytical dimensions through network analysis;</li>
                    <li>To share and brainstorm novel network metrics;</li>
                    <li>To connect researchers with shared interest towards forming a sub-community leading future development in this area.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Workshop Outcomes</h3>
                <p>Accepted workshop papers will be published on the workshop website and in a joint LAK Companion Proceedings (published by SoLAR). Additional workshop materials will also be shared via the workshop website. </p>
                <h3>Workshop Structure</h3>
                <p>The workshop will combine the symposium and interactive workshop session formats.</p>
                <p>Anyone with an interest in the area is welcome to register. To present, participants need to submit proposals for consideration to <a href="mailto:sspoquet@gmail.com">Dr. Poquet</a> by December 15.</p>
                <p>The workshop will be organized around thematic contributions to provide discussion foci for participation in small groups (see possible themes listed above). This interactive format, which was very successful at prior workshops organized by the team, aims to facilitate an inclusive and effective discussion on the day, and onwards. Specifically, the workshop will include the following components: approximately 5 paper presentations; groups organized around presentations; a “birds of a feather” activity organized around themes that emerge from discussions; large-group discussion that sets the agenda for future work in this area.</p>
                <p>Twitter conversations will happen under workshop hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23LAK20Network">#LAK20Network</a>.</p> -->
